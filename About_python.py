Coding meaning developing software or programs through programming languages

#about python
'''
Python is a high level language. It was developed by Guido Van Rossum.
Python first version 0.9.0 was released in February 1991.
Python is based on object oriented programming.
(object = data + methods)
Class is blueprint and object is it's implementation.
Object oriented programming is way to do programming.

#understanding coding

'''
let's say for sloving any problem logically we need data and we use that data to
achieve the results i.e solving the probelms.

similarly in programming , data is used and algorithms are created to solve the
probelms or achieve some task. Algorithm means procedure used to solve a problem.

The language in which we are going to code is Python.

So let's start the first thing to learn are data types. Now you are gonna ask what do you mean by data types?
As the word "data types" data in programming are always classfied into different types.

Here in Python :

let's understand the word syntax sytax means like rules how we write things umm u will se below
'''
#data types of python
'''
for numbers there are three distinct data types :
int = integers such as 1,2,3,0,10,10000(any integers but no point in between)
float = integers with points = 1.1 ,1.562 ,25.64
and there is complex numbers which i don't know much about cause i am dumb in maths.

there are only for numbers we also use words and sentences or letters
for them it is string

i mean str='Chirag' or "Chirag"

str is the keyword like int or float

and in int we write int=10 but for strings it is str="Chirag" apostrophe commas #fuck spellings

and there is something called sequence types it includes list , tuple and range(well to be honest i didn't know range was data type too but google is never wrong)

so what the fuck sequence data type means?(ans from google in my way)

let's assume according to google sequence data type are ordered colletion of different data types , and it allows us to store multiple values.

well it includes list , tuple .

let's see what is a list

well list is a data type that holds diff types of values i mean string int bool etc.

list=[a,b,5,true]

ahh and there is one more thing list can also contain duplicate values.
and it is mutable.Well mutable is who cares.

tuple umm this another sequential data type

tuple=(same as list,45)

i mean tuple and list are same with a two differences
in list we use sqaure brackets in tuple we use round brackets
and list are mutable and tuples are immutable

well you see you inserted the data inside are numbers words and true and false values.
so this is the list,tuple.

mapping data type
mapping data type are with key and pair i mean like if you wanna do this like name:chirag gender:male place:mumbai so you can use this dictonary data type it
is basically used for mapping.

dict={'name':'divyanshu','age':21}

umm i don't think any more explanation is needed.

Boolean data type

it is basically true and false
a=5<1
then a will false.
#simple

soo lets move forward i think
now you know how data are divided in python there are some more data types too but they will be for later

#smoke break

'''
#basic_python_code
'''
when we do a python code we need some software for doing it you i m using python idle you can download it from google
let's do a basic code

print("Hard work beats talent")
so what is print?
well print is a word that is used too print something in the console where we see output
soo for the above statement
it will print-> hard work beats talent

now let's some basic things like add
print("add",1+1)
here it will add and give answer
you can subtact multiply anything
and you can see the synatx too print("add", here this coma is used after the coma it can 2*5 or whatever and in the apostrophe anything you write will be printed there.

so now you know how to print

um next thing would be how to give the data to the systen i mean from console

to take data from the user you will use the word input

i forget to mention about the variable
name="chirag"
here name is the variable
num1=1
here num1 is varibale
variable are used to store data they occupy the memory

lets do a program
lets take two number from the user and add it

num1
num2

we will take this two variable to store number and you know number are int 

so it goes->
num1=int(input("Enter a number:"))
let's understand the statement
here num1 is the variable then int is used cause number is in integer then input is used to take the number from the user and enter a number will be printed there
num2=int(input("Enter second number:"))
num3=num1+num2# here num3 is a new variable taken to store the addition of the num1 and num2
print("Addition",num3) here num3 printed in which num1+num2 is stored

i hope that helps somewhat
